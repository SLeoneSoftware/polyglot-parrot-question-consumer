# polyglot-parrot-question-consumer


## Project Description

IN PROGRESS

A consumer to feed polyglot parrot exam table with questions. As I'm currently revamping "Polyglot Parrot"'s language progression feature, I'm having a queue that trusted sources (Language Teachers, Native Speakers) can submit questions to. This consumer will then add them to a SQLite3 database by calling the API.

## Technologies

This consumer was created using Java, Maven, Spring, and RabbitMQ.

## Use

This was made as part of a social network app. If someone wants familiarity with RabbitMQ, then they can use this code as a basis for the consumer portion.

This application assumes RabbitMQ is running on the default port.

Note that this does not publish any messages.
